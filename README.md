# IssueTracker
Making a issue tracker for managing bugs and tasks
If you are building the front-end for an issue tracking app, you will likely need to know the following concepts in JavaScript:

    DOM manipulation: You will need to be able to update the HTML and CSS of the page based on user interactions and updates from the back-end.
    AJAX: You will need to be able to make asynchronous requests to the back-end to retrieve and update data without refreshing the page.
    JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular or Vue.js: These frameworks provide a structured approach to building web applications, and make it easier to manage the state and updates of the page.
    Form validation: You will need to be able to validate user input and provide feedback on errors.
    Event handling: You will need to handle events such as button clicks and form submissions, and update the page based on the user's actions.
    Routing: If you are building a single-page application, you will need to handle client-side routing to change the URL and update the content displayed based on the route.
    Data structures: You will need to know how to work with arrays and objects to store and manipulate data.
    Asynchronous programming: You will need to know how to work with promises and async/await for handling asynchronous requests and updates.
    
    
Rust is a modern programming language that has gained popularity in recent years for its safety, performance and reliability features. If you are building a back-end for an issue tracking app using Rust and WebAssembly, you will need to have the following knowledge:

    Familiarity with the Rust programming language, its syntax, and the standard library.
    Understanding of Rust's ownership and borrowing model, which are key concepts in Rust's memory safety.
    Familiarity with Rust's macro system, which allows you to write code with less boilerplate and more expressiveness.
    Familiarity with Rust's type system, which allows you to express complex constraints in your types.
    Familiarity with Rust's Cargo package manager and the Rust package ecosystem.
    Understanding of WebAssembly's instruction set, memory model, and JavaScript API.
    Familiarity with the WebAssembly toolchain, including the wasm-pack and wasm-bindgen tool for compiling Rust code to WebAssembly.
    Familiarity with web development tools, such as Webpack or Node.js
    Understanding of how to debug and troubleshoot WebAssembly code using browser developer tools.
    Knowledge of how to optimize the performance of your application
    Understanding of WebAssembly's security model and how to avoid common vulnerabilities.
