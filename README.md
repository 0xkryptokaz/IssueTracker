# IssueTracker
Making a issue tracker for managing bugs and tasks

Things to learn for app 
If you are building the front-end for an issue tracking app, you will likely need to know the following concepts in JavaScript:

    DOM manipulation: You will need to be able to update the HTML and CSS of the page based on user interactions and updates from the back-end.
    AJAX: You will need to be able to make asynchronous requests to the back-end to retrieve and update data without refreshing the page.
    JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular or Vue.js: These frameworks provide a structured approach to building web applications, and make it easier to manage the state and updates of the page.
    Form validation: You will need to be able to validate user input and provide feedback on errors.
    Event handling: You will need to handle events such as button clicks and form submissions, and update the page based on the user's actions.
    Routing: If you are building a single-page application, you will need to handle client-side routing to change the URL and update the content displayed based on the route.
    Data structures: You will need to know how to work with arrays and objects to store and manipulate data.
    Asynchronous programming: You will need to know how to work with promises and async/await for handling asynchronous requests and updates.
